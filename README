Yet Another CakePhp 2.x Blog Plugin

Steps:
1. Import Blog/Config/Schema/posts.sql file to cake db

2. Add the following line to your app/Config/bootstrap.php
    CakePlugin::load('Blog', array('routes' => true));
    *** note: for some reason loadAll doesn't work with this plugin,
        it never loads the routes correctly

Notes:
* All admin routes go through /admin/posts or /admin/posts/:action. If a different
    route config is needed add it to Blog/Config/routes.php
