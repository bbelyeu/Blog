Yet Another CakePhp 2.x Blog Plugin

Steps:
1. Import posts.sql, tags.sql, & posts_tags.sql from Blog/Config/Schema/ file
    into cake db.
    * If you'd like to use an image with blog posts also import images_posts.sql

2. Add the following line to your app/Config/bootstrap.php
    CakePlugin::load('Blog', array('routes' => true));
    *** note: for some reason loadAll doesn't work with this plugin,
        it never loads the routes correctly

Notes:
* All admin routes go through /admin/(posts|tags) or /admin/(posts|tags)/:action.
    If a different route config is needed add it to Blog/Config/routes.php
* If you're using my MysqlImageStorage plugin with the blog, make sure that is 
    loaded in bootstrap.php also.
